Myrecipes app is a flutter app that contains several meal recipes. Just think it's a Cookbook on your phone. The app also allows users to search for recipes and save them to their favorites. The app uses the Edamam API to fetch recipes and display them to the user. The user can also search for recipes by ingredients.
